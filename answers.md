Question 1:
A Database Management System (DBMS) consists of the following components:
Database Engine: Manages data storage, retrieval, and transaction processing.
Database Schema: Defines the structure and organization of data.
Query Processor: Interprets and executes queries, optimizing them for performance.
Data Dictionary: Stores metadata about the database, including definitions and relationships.
Transaction Management: Ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for reliable transactions.
Storage Manager: Handles the physical storage of data and manages file and buffer management.
Security and Authorization: Controls user access, authentication, and encryption.
Backup and Recovery: Ensures data is backed up and can be recovered in case of failure.
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency through constraints and validation rules.
User Interface (UI): Provides interaction tools for users and administrators to manage data.

Question 2
A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, using keys to establish relationships between tables. It allows efficient querying and data management through SQL. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL server and Oracle.

Question 3
DQL: Used to query and retrieve data (e.g., SELECT).
DML: Used to manipulate data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DDL: Used to define and manage database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).

Question 4
A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot have null values. Each table can only have one primary key. Primary Key is Unique, non-null, one per table. A Foreign Key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It can have duplicate values and can be null.Foreign key links tables, can be null, multiple foreign keys allowed in a table.

Question 5
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the structure of a database, showing the relationships between different entities (objects) within the system. It is used in database design to map out how data entities are connected to one another. ERDs are commonly used to model databases at the conceptual and logical levels.

Question 6
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency through constraints like primary and foreign keys.
Ease of Use: SQL makes querying and managing data straightforward.
Flexibility & Scalability: Easily adapts to changes in data and business needs.
Data Security: Provides strong security features, including authentication and encryption.
Transaction Support: Ensures reliable operations with ACID properties for consistency.
Reduces Redundancy: Through normalization, data duplication is minimized.
Relationships Between Data: Efficiently links and retrieves related data using keys.
Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms for data protection and recovery.
Data Independence: Changes in the data structure donâ€™t affect applications.
Standardization: Compatible with various platforms and systems.

Question 7
Integer (INT): Stores whole numbers (e.g., AGE INT).
Varchar (VARCHAR): Stores variable-length strings (e.g., NAME VARCHAR(100)).
Date (DATE): Stores date values in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., JOIN_DATE DATE).
Decimal (DECIMAL): Stores numbers with fixed decimal points, useful for precise values (e.g., SALARY DECIMAL(10, 2)).

Question 8:
A Database Management System (DBMS) manages and organizes data, ensuring its efficient storage, retrieval, and security. Key purposes include:
Efficient Data Management: Organizes data for easy access.
Data Integrity & Security: Ensures accurate and protected data.
Minimizing Redundancy: Reduces data duplication.
Supports Transactions: Ensures reliable and consistent data operations.
Backup & Recovery: Protects against data loss.
